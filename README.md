# SG-Eady-slice
MATLAB functions for solving the semi-geostrophic Eady slice equations using the geometric method.

## Getting started ##
To use these MATLAB functions you must first install

* [MATLAB-Voro](https://github.com/smr29git/MATLAB-Voro)

## Examples ##

See the MATLAB live script ``Examples.mlx`` and the corresponding PDF file ``Examples.pdf``. We have tested the code with several initial conditions including: random initial seeds; a stable perturbation of a steady shear flow with up to 1,000 seeds; an unstable perturbation of a steady shear flow with up to 7,000 seeds.
